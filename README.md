Tinder for Plex

1. User logins in to plex
2. Display list of media libraries. They toggle on / off the ones they way to view
4. Maybe associate a user entered name with their client id (how else can we uniquely indentify users?)
3. Go into card swipe display and let them swipe through
    - Provide options where they can change their criteria
        - Recently Added
        - Unwatched
        - Search for specific movie / show
        - Only show what other users have already swiped.
